# Testcase Generator
A simple C++ program to automate the process of generating input and output testcase files when creating and hosting problem statements for competitive programming contests on Hackerrank, Hackerearth, Codechef, Codeforces and other custom contests which require multiple input and output files to test the participant's solutions. 

## Running the Code
- Setup the [C++](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp) environment.
- Clone the repository.
- Paste the problem statement's solution input and output code in the population function in [tc_generator.cpp](tc_generator.cpp). (A sample solution snippet has been given for reference.) 
- Compile [tc_generator.cpp](tc_generator.cpp) and run it.
- Enter the number of input and output testcase files to be generated along with your testcases (refer [inputs.txt](inputs.txt)). 

All input and output testcase files will be generated in [/input](/input) and [/output](/output).
